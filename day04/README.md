# Playwright Architecture

Playwright is a node library that provides a high-level API to control web browsers. It facilitates real-time interaction and automation by communicating with browser instances through WebSocket connections and the Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP).

## Internal Working with WebSockets

Playwright establishes a WebSocket connection to browser instances, enabling it to send commands and receive events in a non-blocking, asynchronous manner. This WebSocket-based communication is crucial for efficiently automating browser operations such as navigation, input, and rendering.

# Understanding Browser, Context, and Pages

In Playwright, automation is structured around three key objects: Browser, Context, and Pages, each serving distinct roles in the automation workflow.

## Browser

Represents an instance of a web browser. Playwright can control multiple Browser instances simultaneously, with each operating in its isolated environment.

## Context
A Browser Context simulates an incognito session, allowing for parallel tests in a single Browser instance without shared cookies, localStorage, or session data.

## Pages

A Page object represents a single browser tab or window, serving as the primary interface for web content interaction, including navigation and element manipulation.
