-> Playwright Test Runner
-> Break
-> OOPS (class, object,Access Modifiers)
-> BreakoutSession
-> Inheritance
-> BreakoutSession
-> Polymorphsim



Test Annotation: configure the Behaviour of the test
test.only -> run the test which marked as only
test.skip -> test will not run
test.fail -> Mark test as expected to fail
test.fixme -> mark test as not ready yet
test.use -> override context 
test.info -> it shows additional information about test
test.describe -> group your test
test.describe.parallel -> run tests in parallel
test.describe.serial -> run tests in serial



oops with typescript

OOPs-> Object Oriented Programming Language
-> Object
java script -> prototype based
-> Reusability
-> Maintainable
-> Readable
-> Scalability
-> Redundancy
-> Modularity


Class:

A Class is like a template or buleprint that defines properties and methods 
to all object of that type.

* properties let name="Dilip" 
let name:string="Dilip"

* methods -> launchBrowser(){
}

* constructor -> it will initialize the class properties and Methods while cereating Object

class Browser{

//properties
empName:string="Dilip"

//method
browserDetails(){

}

//constructor -  two types
1. Default -> constructor(){
}

2. parameter -> constructor(user:string){
this.empName=user
}



this-> will reffer the current class properties and methods

constructor:
1. Default -> constructor()
2. paramter -> constructor(user:string,age:number)


OOPs: 

Inheritance:
its a relationship between two class
parent class and child class

types:
Single Inheritance :  parent -> child
Multilevel Inheritance : GrandParent -> parent -> child
Hierarchical Inheritance : browser -> chrome ,browser -> edge , browser->firefox 

ts -> it will  not support mulitple Inheritance -> PA&PB -> PC

keyword: extends
child extends parent  -> work

parent extends child ->this will not work


ClassRoom 2:
Parent file
 Create class Browser
 Create 2 methods browserType, protected browserVersion

Child file
Create class Chrome 
Create 1 method launchBrowser
create object for Chrome


Polymorphsim:

-> many forms

2 types Polymorphsim:

1.Method overloading -> Complie poly
2.Method overriding -> Run poly

Method overloading:
Inside the same class we can create multiple method with same Method name,but 
different paramters should be passed

class Base{

Elementclick(locator:string):void
Elementclick(locator:string,forceCick:string):void

Elementclick(locator:string){

}


}


Method overriding:
use Method overriding -> Inheritance
connect between two different class with same method signature and paramters only 
implemenation can change

export class parent{

phone(){
console.log(iphone 15)
}
}
//object-> iphone 15

clas child extends parent{

phone(){
console.log(iphone 16 pro)
}
}
//object-> iphone 16 pro
