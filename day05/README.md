Playwright is a node library that provides a high-level API to control web browsers. It facilitates real-time interaction and automation by communicating with browser instances through WebSocket connections and the Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP).

Internal Working with WebSockets
Playwright establishes a WebSocket connection to browser instances, enabling it to send commands and receive events in a non-blocking, asynchronous manner. This WebSocket-based communication is crucial for efficiently automating browser operations such as navigation, input, and rendering.

Understanding Browser, Context, and Pages
In Playwright, automation is structured around three key objects: Browser, Context, and Pages, each serving distinct roles in the automation workflow.

Browser
Represents an instance of a web browser. Playwright can control multiple Browser instances simultaneously, with each operating in its isolated environment.

Context
A Browser Context simulates an incognito session, allowing for parallel tests in a single Browser instance without shared cookies, localStorage, or session data.

Pages
A Page object represents a single browser tab or window, serving as the primary interface for web content interaction, including navigation and element manipulation.

Fixtures
Fixtures in Playwright provide a powerful way to setup and tear down resources needed for your tests, helping you manage common objects like browser instances, pages, and custom configurations in a reusable manner.

What is a Fixture?
A fixture is essentially a piece of code that can run before and after each test, or a suite of tests, to set up the environment in which the tests will run. This can include creating a new browser instance, a new page, logging into an application.

The Page Fixture
One of the most commonly used fixtures in Playwright tests is the page fixture. It provides a fresh browser page for each test, ensuring test isolation and reducing the likelihood of side effects between tests.

Usage
When using Playwright Test, the page fixture is automatically available in each test, and you do not need to explicitly declare it. Here’s how you can use it:

import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test("Learning fixtures", async ({page}) =>{

    await page.goto("https://login.salesforce.com/");
    await page.fill("#username", "ranjini.r@testleaf.com");
    await page.fill("#password", "Testleaf@543");
    await page.click("#Login");

});
